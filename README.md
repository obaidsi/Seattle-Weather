# Seattle-Weather
This is a simple project that showcases basic object-oriented programming with java. 
Weather-Manager is the starting point of this project. WeatherManager reads the Seattle Weather data from a SeattleWeather.txt and stores the information into the objects. 
These objects are then stored in an ArrayList for further data processing. 
WeatherManager has some interesting methods, for example, calc average Temperature for a month, the Rainiest month in the year, etc.
The scanner is used to read the data from the text file.
